This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Define the vector x
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 0.01)

# Print the first few elements of x to verify
head(x)
```

```{r}
# Create the vector y, where each element is the sine of the corresponding element in x
y <- sin(x)

# Print the first few elements of y to verify
head(y)
```

```{r}
# Create the data frame sin_df with two columns: x and y
sin_df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

# Inspect the first few rows of the data frame
head(sin_df,3)
```


```{r}
# Plot sin_df with x as the x-axis and y as the y-axis
plot(sin_df$x, sin_df$y, type = "l", col = "blue", 
     xlab = "x", ylab = "sin(x)", main = "Plot of sin(x)")
# sin_df$x: Refers to the x column in the data frame.
# sin_df$y: Refers to the y column in the data frame (the sine of x values).
```
$$ \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 $$
