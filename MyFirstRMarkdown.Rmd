## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Create the vectors
ani <- c("Snake", "Ostrich", "Cat", "Spider")
num <- c(0, 2, 4, 8)

# Combine into a data frame
animals_df <- data.frame(ani, num)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# Print the data frame
animals_df
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
# Generate a sequence from 12 to 2 with steps of -2
x_vect <- seq(from = 12, to = 2, by = -2)

# Print the vector
x_vect

```
```{r}
X <- matrix(x_vect, 2,3)
X
```


```{r}
Y <- matrix(seq(4),2,2)
Y
```

```{r}
# Create the 2x2 matrix Z
Z <- matrix(c(4, 6, 8, 10), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

# Print the matrix
Z
```

```{r}
# Compute the transpose of matrix Y
Y_transposed <- t(Y)

# Print the transposed matrix
Y_transposed
```

```{r}
# Compute the transpose of matrix Y
Z_transposed <- t(Z)

# Print the transposed matrix
Z_transposed
```
```{r}
# Compute the sum of matrices Y and Z
sum_Y_Z <- Y + Z

# Print the result
sum_Y_Z

```


```{r}
# Compute the matrix product Y * Z
YZ <- Y %*% Z

# Print the result
YZ
```

```{r}
# Compute the matrix product Z * Y
ZY <- Z %*% Y

# Print the result
ZY
```

```{r}
# Compute the matrix product Y * X
YX <- Y %*% X

# Print the result
YX
```
```{r}
# Compute the matrix product X * Y
XY <- X %*% Y

# Print the result
XY # Error in X %*% Y : 非整合参数
```

```{r}
# Compute the element-wise matrix multiplication Y * Z
element_wise_product <- Y * Z

# Print the result
element_wise_product
```
```{r}
Y_1 <- solve(Y)
Y_1

```
```{r}
Y_1X <- Y_1 %*% X
Y_1X
```
