<!-- We need to load two packages, namely “Stat2Data” and “tidyverse” -->

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Stat2Data)
data("Hawks")

```
# 1. Visualisation

## 1. (Q1)

<!--  about visualisation using ggplot2 -->

```{r}
hawksSmall<- drop_na(select(Hawks,Age,Day,Month,Year,CaptureTime,Species,Wing,Weight,Tail))
# Check the dimensions (rows and columns) of hawksSmall
dim(hawksSmall)

# Display the first 5 rows of hawksSmall
head(hawksSmall, 5)
```
## 1. (Q2)

```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 package if not already loaded
library(ggplot2)

# Create a histogram of hawks' weights with a bin width of 10
ggplot(hawksSmall, aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Hawk Weights",
       x = "Weight",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()



```
## 1. (Q3)
```{r}
# 创建两个不同 adjust 参数的密度图
ggplot(hawksSmall, aes(x = Tail)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 0.5, color = "red", fill = "red", alpha = 0.3) +  # adjust = 0.5
  geom_density(adjust = 2, color = "blue", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +  # adjust = 2
  labs(title = "Density map of eagle tail length",
       x = "tail lengths",
       y = "density") +
  theme_minimal()




```
## 1. (Q4)
Based on the answer from (Q3), create density plot based on 3 species.

```{r}
# Three species, CH, RT and SS, were screened
hawks_filtered <- subset(hawksSmall, Species %in% c("CH", "RT", "SS"))

# Plot tail length density based on CH, RT, and SS species
ggplot(hawks_filtered, aes(x = Tail, color = Species, fill = Species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, adjust = 2) +  # adjust=1
  labs(title = "Tail length density of eagle in CH, RT, SS species",
       x = "tail lengths",
       y = "density") +
  theme_minimal()


```

## 1. (Q5) Violin plot:
<!--  Use the ggplot and geom_violin() functions to create the following violin plot for the three species. -->
```{r}
ggplot(hawks_filtered, aes(x = Tail, y = Species, fill = Species)) +
  geom_violin(trim = TRUE, adjust = 1) +  # Use the violin diagram with clipping the tail
  labs(title = "Violin diagram of tail length of different species of eagle",
       x = "Species (mm)",
       y = "Tail Lengths") +
  theme_minimal()

```
## 1. (Q6) Scatter plot
<!-- Generate a plot similar to the following plot using the ggplot() and geom_point() functions.
1. How many aesthetics are present within the following plot?
2. What are the glyphs within this plot?
3. What are the visual cues being used within this plot
-->
```{r}
# Create a scatter plot using geom_point()
ggplot(hawks_filtered, aes(x = Tail, y = Weight, color = Species, shape=Species)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of tail length of different species of eagle",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Tail Lengths") +
  theme_minimal()
```
## 1. (Q7) Trend lines and facet wraps:
<!-- Generate the following plot using the ggplot(), geom_point(), geom_smooth() and 
facet_wrap() functions. Note that in the facet plot, the three panels use different 
scales. 
1. What are the visual cues being used within this plot?
2. Based on the plot below, what can we say about the relationship between the weight of the hawks and their tail lengths?
-->

```{r}
ggplot(hawks_filtered, aes(x = Tail, y = Weight, color = Species)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2)) +  # 散点
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +  # 添加线性回归线
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +  # 按物种分面，使用不同的坐标轴比例
  labs(title = "Relationship between tail length and weight in 3 species",
       x = "Tail (mm)", 
       y = "Weight") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgray")) 



```
## 1. (Q8) Adding annotations
<!-- First, compute the “Weight” and the “Tail” of the heaviest hawk in the dataset. You 
can use filter() and select() function to select proper data. 
Second, reuse the code that you create from Q(3), adding an arrow and an 
annotation to indicate the heaviest hawk. Your result should look similar to this.
-->
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# 找到最重的鹰，并提取 Weight 和 Tail 列
heaviest_hawk <- hawksSmall %>%
  filter(Weight == max(Weight)) %>%  # 找到最大体重的鹰
  select(Weight, Tail)  # 选择 Weight 和 Tail 列

# 查看结果
print(heaviest_hawk)


```
```{r}
# 找到最重的鹰
heaviest_hawk <- hawks_filtered %>%
  filter(Weight == max(Weight))  # 筛选出最重的鹰

# 创建散点图
ggplot(hawks_filtered, aes(x = Tail, y = Weight, color = Species, shape = Species)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Tail lengths of different species",
       x = "Tail",
       y = "Weight") +
  theme_minimal() +
  # 添加箭头指向最重的鹰
  geom_segment(aes(x = heaviest_hawk$Tail, y = heaviest_hawk$Weight,
                   xend = heaviest_hawk$Tail + 5, yend = heaviest_hawk$Weight + 5), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "inches")), 
               color = "red", size = 1) +
  # 添加注释
  annotate("text", x = heaviest_hawk$Tail + 5, y = heaviest_hawk$Weight + 5,
           label = paste("Heaviest Hawk"),
           color = "red", size = 4, hjust = 0)
```
# 2. Finite probability spaces
## 2.1 Sampling with replacement
Recall that for positive integers 𝑛 and 𝑘, $(\frac{𝑛}{𝑘}) =\frac{𝑛!}{𝑘!(𝑛−𝑘)!}$ gives the number of subsets of size 𝑘 from a set of 𝑛 objects.
You can compute this number straightforwardly within “R” via the choose function “choose()”

```{r}
# 计算从 8 个对象中选择 3 个对象的组合数
n <- 8  # 集合大小
k <- 3  # 子集大小

# 使用 choose 函数计算组合数
num_combinations <- choose(n, k)

# 打印结果
print(num_combinations)
```
### (Q1) 
<!-- Write down a mathematical expression for the probability that 𝑧 out of the 22
selections were red spheres (here 𝑧 ∈ {0,1, ⋯ ,22}).-->
<!-- You can try writing down your mathematical expression using “LaTex” code in your 
R markdown file, making use of the LaTex functions “binom{”{}} and “frac{”{}}. For 
information about writing mathematical formulae in Rmarkdown documents, find 
illustrative examples in “Assignment_R MarkdownMathformulasandSymbolsExamples.rmd”-->
